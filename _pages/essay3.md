Changing one's mindset is one of the hardest things to do initially[<sup>1</sup>](#note1). If one wants to truly progress in life, then one of the greatest assets here would be to start reading. It's not the only thing, but it can serve as a gateway that leads to other gateways, with possibilities that could compound from there.

If you're not used to reading books beyond textbooks, you might have preconceived notions like "It's not my cup of tea," "It’s boring," or "I don't like novels and philosophy are for old's." I was no different. I always ignored the possibility of getting into reading until my late undergraduate years. But deep inside, I always felt I should give it a try. After many instances of self-rejection, I decided to grab one book, and it changed my mental landscape forever.

I wanted to start small. The book I stumbled upon was _As a Man Thinketh_ (48 pages). I think it was some quotes that drew me to it, but I don't clearly remember where I actually encountered it. Nevertheless, it was the key to the first door. I finished the book in one sitting, and for the first time, it felt like a big achievement. I reread the book many times, and each time, I practiced introspecting on the ideas being discussed[<sup>2</sup>](#note2). After that, I was drawn to reading more books and essays, especially non-fiction, philosophy, and some religious.

Here are few books that have significantly shaped my thinking:

- _As a Man Thinketh_
- _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_
- _Meditations_
- _Mastery_
- _The Laws of Human Nature_
- _48 Laws of Power_
- _Paul Graham Essays_
- _Bhagavad Gita_

**Notes:**

<a name="note1"></a>1. Mindset changes are often hindered by our own assumptions. Most of us grow in a linear fashion, guided by an unchallenged belief system shaped since childhood.

<a name="note2"></a>2. Introspecting is a valuable skill to develop. It helps you internalize and truly understand what’s being discussed, relate it to different contexts, and assess its relevance. Not everything you read will be well-founded; there may be flaws, and some content needs to be discounted. For me, this habit slowed down my reading pace, but it greatly refined my ability to filter and assess content.
